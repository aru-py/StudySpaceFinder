Can’t find a place to study on campus? Or have spare time between classes and have nowhere to go? This app allows you to search for every class and building and check if it is being used or not. You can “reserve” a class and see how many people are occupying a given classroom. The app also shows the schedule of the classroom and during what time there are classes in session. This app was created to help alleviate the shortage of study spaces on campus and because Cooper Library is overcrowded.
