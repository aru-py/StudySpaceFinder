# study-space-finder

## Overview
It’s difficult to find a quiet study space on Clemson University’s campus. This web app uses course registration data to find periods in which campus classrooms are being unused, whether you just need a spot to unwind between classes or hours of uninterrupted silence. The goal of this project was to help reduce overcrowding at Cooper Library, and after surveying hundreds of students, it was **proposed to the university in March of 2020**.  

## Prototype
A defunct example will be permanently available at [studyspacefinder.web.app](https://studyspacefinder.web.app/), but the class registration data used is from Fall 2019 and is outdated.

## Notes
Unfortunately, the university was not in a position to accept such a proposal due to various external factors, such as safety, that would have to be considered. I wish to thank all those who contributed to this endeavor, both with code and thoughts.
