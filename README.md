Can’t find a place to study on campus? Or have spare time between classes and have nowhere to go? This app allows you to find unused classrooms to study in. You can search for all classrooms, a single building, or a favorite classroom. You can also “reserve” a classroom and likewise see the number of people in classroom. The app also shows the schedule of the classroom thoughout the entire day so you can also plan ahead and reserve beforehand. This app was created in response to the overcrowding problem at Cooper Library and the growing shortage of study spaces across campus as Clemson University continues to expand.
